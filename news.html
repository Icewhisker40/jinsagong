                <h2>Microplastics - The emerging threat! </h2>
                <h5>By Jin Sagong - 2/29/2024</h5>

            <div class="news-p-container">
                <p class="news-p">  Imagine the number of stars in our galaxy, approximately 100 billion, multiplied by 50, which equates to 5 trillion. Now imagine if instead of stars, 5.25 trillion microplastics, weighing 269,000 tons altogether, filled the earth. According to Surfers Against Sewage, a charity dedicated to marine conservation, this is our reality. </p>
                <p class="news-p">  Microplastics are particles of plastic that are less than 5 millimeters in length. There are two types of microplastics, primary and secondary. Primary microplastics are tiny particles designed for commercial use. They are often found in cosmetics and microfibers shed from clothing and other textiles, including fishing nets. Secondary microplastics are particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items.They are very small and hard to see, and can be found everywhere, from the ocean, the air, to even a plastic water bottle or bag. This breakdown is caused by exposure to environmental factors, mainly the sun’s radiation and ocean waves.</p>
                <p class="news-p">  How much plastic do you think gets recycled? With only 9% of plastics getting recycled, other plastics end up in the land-fill or in the ocean and ground, littering the world. These abandoned plastics will eventually turn into microplastics. Microplastics are small but very dangerous to marine life and human life. According to Ocean Care, another marine conservation organization, tiny bits of plastic can end up in a fish’s stomach without it even noticing. If you think that humans are not involved and immune to these issues, you would be mistaken. Humans also have microplastics in their bloodstream, which can travel around the body and lodge in organs.</p>
                <p class="news-p">  Microplastic particles are found on both sides of the human placenta (both maternal and fetal) for the first time, in a study led by Antonio Ragusa of the San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli Hospital. Six placentas were observed and found to contain a variety of plastics commonly used in man-made coatings, paints, adhesives, plasters, finger paints, polymers, cosmetics, and personal care products of various colors. Based on a quick search, while we aren’t sure if mothers/children have been affected by this, microplastics have been shown to harm human cells in the laboratory. </p>
                <p class="news-p">  It is not too late to make a difference. To reduce microplastics, try to stop using plastics. Instead of using a plastic shopping bag, you can use a reusable bag from home. Replace a plastic water bottle with a reusable one. There are lots of ways to reduce plastic use in your life! Another thing you can do is participate in beach cleanups weekly or once a month with your family or friends. Beach cleanups are helpful because you are getting rid of plastic before an animal eats it, or before it turns into microplastics. Walking around the beaches could be a good chance to exercise for you.</p>
                <p class="news-p">  You can also inform others about the harmful effects of microplastics and help us reduce it. Visit your local library or simply browse the Internet to find out more about microplastics, and spread awareness to everyone. Feel free to reference any of the information in this news article. Invite others to join us in reducing microplastics.</p>
