            <h3>Microplastics are :</h3>
            <p> *Tiny particles less than 5mm</p>
            <p> *There are two types of microplastics, both as dangerous as each other. </p> 
            <h4> Primary microplastics :</h4>
            <p>  Primary microplastics are tiny particles designed for commercial use. 
                They are often found in cosmetics and microfibers shed from clothing and other textiles,
                including fishing nets.</p>
                <h4> Secondary microplastics :</h4>
            <p>  Secondary microplastics are particles that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items.They are very small and hard to see, and can be found everywhere, from the ocean, the air, to even a plastic water bottle or bag. This breakdown is caused by exposure to environmental factors, mainly the sunâ€™s radiation and ocean waves.</p>
            <h4>Why are microplastics bad for you?</h4>
            <p>Microplastics have entered the human bloodstream, and due to that, it could potentially lead to health risks such as oxidiative stress, DNA damage, organ dysfunction, and more (As you can see on my first poster). </p>
            <p>And recent studies show that microplastics enter a baby's body by the umbilical cord. Whenever the mother eats something, she could also ingest microplastics at the same time, making the baby ingest it too.</p>
